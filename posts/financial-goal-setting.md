Before going into the debate of long-term versus short-term investments, it is crucial to establish clear financial goals. In this article, we will discuss the significance of goal setting as a preliminary step in your investment journey.

> **Goal setting is a powerful process for thinking about your ideal future, and for motivating yourself to turn your vision into reality.**

Understanding and defining your financial objectives, helps you align your investment strategies to maximize the likelihood of achieving them. Financial goals can vary depending on factors such as income, debt or assets, life stage and much more. By knowing your financial objectives, you establish an awareness that enriches your degree of Financial literacy, and if you need to extend your current knowledge within the area, before starting your investment journey.

Examples of financial objects are <em>to get out of debt</em>, <em>early retirement</em>,<em>financial independent</em> and much more. For more inspiration check out financial markets articles about various goals <a href="https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/good-financial-goals/" target="_blank"><em>here.</em></a>

Financial literacy - emphasized by renowned entrepreneur and author Robert Kiyosaki in his bestseller <em>“Rich Dad Poor Dad”</em> - underlines the importance of acquiring financial education and applying that knowledge to one's personal finances. While we will dig deeper into the concept of financial literacy in a future article, it is essential to understand that it encompasses the ability to comprehend and gain expertise in matters of personal finance and money management.

I mainly divide financial goal settings into 4 pillars:

1. Assessment of your financial situation.
2. Defining and quantifying financial goals.
3. Investment strategies.
4. Tracking and guidance.

## Assessment of your financial situation

The process of assessing your financial situation is a critical step towards successful investing. It involves evaluating your current financial status, and to gain a comprehensive understanding of your resources, obligations, and overall financial health. The main areas of focus are <em>income</em>, <em>expense</em>, <em>asset</em>, <em>liabilities</em> and <em>cash flow</em>.

**Budget** <br>
In Denmark, we're faily familiar with assessing our financial situation, as it is often required by banks to aquire a loan for an apartment of house. This is usually done by creating a detailed budget. The budget will cover income, expenses and your net income which is your monthly income sources (salary, investments, rental income etc), subtracted with the montly expenses (rent, mortgage, utilities, instalments from debt, interest rates, subscriptions groceries etc).

The more details you provide within your budget, the better the overview of you finacial situation you will get. Tracking your income and expenses over time will help you identify your fixed and variable sources of your cash flow. In my own situation, for example, I know the dentist or hairdresser is not a monthly expense, but I have calculated the expense to what I would be on a monthly basis, to add it into the budget. If the dentist bill is $300 every six months, I know my budget can have a added expense of $50 a month. Following this simple approach can provide a more accurate cash flow.

The full overview of the budget and cash flow is a great way to understand where your money is being allocated, along with how much money can be invested or saved, depending on your financial goals (covered in step 2). It can also provide you with a better understanding of your spending habits and identify areas, where you can reduce discretionary expenses or make adjustments

**Assets and liabilities** <br>
An asset is something that hold substantial value wheras a liability is something that you owes. These might not be visible in the budget, so it can be relevant to create a seperate list for them. A saving acount, stocks, bonds or other valuable possesions can be listed here. Same goes with a rental property, in terms of its value, but not the rental income, which is listed as an income. Same logic applies to liabilities such as the value of a loan, debt or other obligations. Analyzing your assets and liabilities provides a snapshot of your net worth and helps determine your overall financial position.

Robert Kiyosaki famously claims, that the house you live in is <a href="https://www.richdad.com/is-house-an-asset" target="_blank"><em>NOT an asset</em></a>. This depends on the view you take on it, as he focus on asset putting money into your pocket (generating positive cash flow) and a liability as something that takes money out of your pocket (generating negative cash flow). In that context, he is right, but in the overall definition of an asset being something that hold substantial value, your <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" target="_blank"><em>house/apartment IS an asset</em></a>. Therefore pay attention to talks about asset and liabilities in regard to the context it is being used.

By thoroughly assessing these aspects of your financial situation, you gain a clear understanding of your current financial standing. This assessment serves as a foundation for setting meaningful financial goals, developing appropriate investment strategies, and making informed financial decisions. It also helps identify areas for improvement and highlights areas where adjustments or corrective actions may be needed to enhance your overall financial well-being.

## Defining and quantifying financial goals

Now you define what you want to achieve financially. This involves determining your short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives. Common financial goals includes saving for retirement, purchasing a home, funding education, starting a business, or achieving financial independence. Take the time to reflect on your aspirations and prioritize them based on their importance and timeline. Note; breaking down goals into smaller milestones for better tracking can make long-term goals more manageable.

Once you have defined your financial goals, the next step is to attach specific monetary targets to each goal. Quantifying your goals makes them measurable and provides a clear target to work towards. Instead of a vague goal like "saving for retirement," quantify it by determining the desired amount you want to accumulate by the time you retire. Similarly, if you aim to purchase a home, establish a specific target for the down payment amount or the total purchase price.

Numerous financial tools and resources are available to assist you in quantifying your goals effectively. Online calculators, financial planning software, or working with a financial advisor can help you estimate the required savings or investment amounts.

By attaching specific monetary targets to your objectives, you gain clarity and direction, making it easier to make informed decisions and develop effective investment strategies. Remember, the process of defining and quantifying your goals is dynamic and requires regular review and adjustment.

## Investment strategies

Different goals require different investment approaches based on factors such as time horizon, risk tolerance, and desired returns.

Short-term goals typically have a time horizon of one to three years. These goals may include saving for a vacation, purchasing a vehicle, or building an emergency fund. Given the relatively short timeframe, capital and liquidity become key considerations. Options can be low-risk investments like savings accounts wiht interest rates, money market funds, or short-term bonds.

Medium and long-term goals typically have a time horizon of more than three years (the more years, the longer an investment term). These goals may include down payment for a house, funding education, retirement or financial freedom. Options here are stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, real estate, retirement accounts or investing in businesses. These are typically growth-oriented investments, but depending on how long the term, the diversication can be managed accordingly with for example index funds and dividend paying stocks that are highly liquid and easy to sell.

## Tracking and guidance

Financial goals are not set in stone. It's essential to review and adjust them periodically to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with your evolving circumstances. Life events, changes in income, or shifts in priorities may force you to modify your goals. Regularly revisit your goals, to track progress, make necessary adjustments, and stay on course.

In both short-term and long-term strategies it is important to consider the degreee of involvement on a regular basis. The more passive the invesment is - like index funds - the less you have to monitor the invesment. in contract, the more active the invemstment is - currency trading or crypto currencies for example - the more risky it is, and you have to monitor it regularly due to its volalitity giving high risk high reward.

in situations with uncertanty, consulting with a financial advisor or planner to assist in goal setting and investment planning can be of great value. A qualified advisor can help assess your goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation to recommend appropriate investment strategies. They can provide personalized advice, monitor your progress, and make adjustments as needed. Be mindful of tax implications and seek guidance on tax-efficient investment strategies based on your country's tax rules.

Remember, conduct thorough research before taking on professional advice and ensure they have the relevant qualifications, certifications and a solid reputation. If not careful, you might risk getting professional advice where hidden fees suddenly appears, getting unrelevant or even bad guidance. A professional from a bank is not nessecarily the perfect match for you, as the advisor also has the agenda of making money of you as his/her client.
