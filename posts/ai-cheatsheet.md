To follow the trend I (ofc) had to share yet another AI sheet with so many tools, that you're overwhelmed. I'm sure that you're drowning in these, just as I, but at the same time I want to stay up to day with the next ChatGPT, Bard, Bing Chat, Jasper or the likes that takes all by storm.

It is worth noting that EU recently addressed the artificial intelligence wave with their first ever legislation on the subject. I shared it on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbroe7/" target="_blank">LinkedIn account</a>, so make sure to follow for updates. Otherwise you can read more about it <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence?&at_campaign=20226-Digital&at_medium=Google_Ads&at_platform=Search&at_creation=RSA&at_goal=TR_G&at_advertiser=Webcomm&at_audience=artificial%20intelligence%20act&at_topic=Artificial_intelligence_Act&at_location=DK&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7aqkBhDPARIsAKGa0oLYv6EweR-DEDt_saWKOlJvYpLgsJu5pJE63eXs86nON7qPXKV17eUaAoDjEALw_wcB" target="_blank"> here</a>

Besides the big and obvious language models, that's been given so much attention, this list of tools to run specific tasks is long and growing by the hour.
