Besides my very first introduction <a href="/blog/welcome-post" target="_blank"><em>post</em></a>, this is the first blogpost on my journey, and why not start with my origins to let you know who the author behind the blog is, and my reasonings behind development of the blog. I will divide this post into four main areas of topics.

1. Who am I.
2. My journey.
3. Roadmap.
4. Mentions.

## Who am I

My name is Daniel Broe and I’m a fullstack developer from Denmark (insert equivalent fancy jobtitle for a computer programmer). Besides being a developer I also have the responsibility as an IT consultant, meaning to offer advice and expertise to client within various IT projects. Via this blog I also engage into consult within personal development by engaging in all the topics I write about, and more. I'm 36 years old and have to girls (6 and 3 at the time of this writing), living happily in the suburbs. Outside work and my blog, the time is well spent on family and friends. Being outdoor in the garden and enjoying the sun is a great habit of ours, and when I get time to myself it usually involves football, working out or me beeing nerdy within the topics of this blog. For me, learning is a non-stop actively that I have grown to love over the years, unlike in school where I perceived it as something 'to get it over with".

> Part of this blog is, not only to keeep me on my toes and learning, but also being on the forefront within the domains to be the best version of myself to my family.

## My journey

My academic background is within economy, strategy and other soft-skills related courses, aimed at being a management consultant. As part of my education and went to San Diego, CA for a year as part of my master. The time abroad was vital in my personal development journey, and a period in my development that stands out as a moment of enlightenment in regard to self-development. I constantly was learning – not only in school, but socially, cultural, language improvement, mentally and really in most aspects of life (and that learning and growing is a never ending journey).

Prior to my current job, I’ve had small jobs next to school – all usually focused and learning a skill I found relevant for my future development. In 2015 I started working for <a href="https://nttdata-solutions.com/" target="_blank"><em>NTT Data Business Solutions (NTTData)</em></a>. The first four years I was working within IT/Finance, where I discovered my passion for web development. I have no computer science background, so it did not seem like a possible path for me, but for the last 3½ years I have worked as a developer full time, still within NTT Data within their developer department.

I took courses at night and on weekends. I found some developers I could use as mentors and help me guide me in the right learning path. The transition from working with finance to now work within web development was not a hard at it may sound like. The soft-skills from being a consultant is still of great importance, and it was more or less all about finding the motivation and dedication to success.

> Keep working in finance was not an option and working with IT, as a developer, became a **must** for me. Turning things into a **must** helped me find the dedication and motivation to succeed

## Roadmap

I managed to transition into being a developer, now what?
blog, freelance, build community, reach out and help people grow, make myself grow to be the best possible version of myself for my family.

## Mentions

Perhaps I will be inspiring someone someday, to do something that will improve the life of the person, and that will be a huge win for me. Therefore I would also like to take the time to appreciate some of those who have been an inspiration or role model to me in my journey. The list is long, so cannot mention all. It is one thing to set a goal, but following it to the finish line and reaching it, is a whole other battle.

For inspiration and motivation, I used some content creators, entrepreneurs and developers. A big shout out to:

- <a href="https://wesbos.com/" target="_blank">**Wes Bos**</a>, fullstack javascript developer and co-host of SyntaxFM, content from podcast and own courses
- <a href="https://www.traversymedia.com/" target="_blank">**Brad Traversy**</a>, developer with javascript focus and expands from there. Used content from Youtube and Udemy
- <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/" target="_blank">**Tony Robbins**</a>, entrepreneur, life-coach, speaker and leading teacher within personal development.
- <a href="https://mortenmunster.com/" target="_blank">**Morten Münster**</a>, writer and leading figure in The Nordics within behavioral design, human behavior and the psychological aspect of people's actions.
- <a href="https://www.larstvede.com/" target="_blank">**Lars Tvede**</a>, entrepreneur, investor and author. Written many books within business and touches upon personal development from a business, political and investment point of view.

All of them got my highest recommendations and is definitely worth a follow on the social media channels, or even better just try some of their content out. Most of them got some free content, so you can easily figure out if their work is something for you. Going back to my goals for the blog, I would say the if I can get to a point where I offer such quality content that I can help just 1 % of what just one of the above does today, I would call the blog-project a huge success.

Hopefully, this story can fuel you with focus on motivation and dedication to achieve your goals – which is some of the most important skills for you to reach the goals you set out, even though your background or current toolkit doesn’t make the goals appear obvious yet. They didn't for me either, but the most important skills in life is not within a specific profession, but it lies within you, and to reach those is what personal development is all about
