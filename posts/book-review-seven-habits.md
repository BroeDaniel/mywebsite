In the pursuit of personal and professional excellence, few resources have left a more indelible mark than Stephen R. Covey's monumental work, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People". This book is not merely a collection of theoretical principles; it's a comprehensive guide that equips readers with practical tools to transform their lives. Covey's profound insights illuminate a clear path to self-development, offering a blueprint to navigate challenges, foster meaningful relationships, and ultimately, achieve lasting success. Let us dive into the core principles of this book, understand how each habit contributes to a holistic journey of self-mastery and empowerment.

I rate this books as a **must read** 10/10 within personal development.

There are 3 techniques for better learning, which applies to getting those habit working as part of your life:

1. Learning
2. Teach
3. Practice

Basically learn the material, the habit or what you are interested in. Once you have learned it, start teaching in the topic as that will provide repetition for your learning. Lastly, practice what you have learned so you do not just talk the talk, but you also walk the walk. This is the fundamental way to really get whatever you are trying to learn, to be part of you, as you specialize within the area and can adapt to it, making you an expert within the field. Same techniques apply to making a desired habit a part of your way of living and to change your paradigm.

Instead, give appreciation and encouragement to make people want to do what you wish of them. It provides people with the feeling of importance. Simply put, address their needs and how they can get it, in order for you to get what you want.

By valuing and respecting others' perspectives, we can foster a positive atmosphere, laying the foundation for genuine connections. This section of the book outlines the following principles to sum it up.

- Principle 1: Don't criticize, condeem or complain.
- Princilpe 2: Give honest and censere appreciation.
- Principle 3: Erouse in the other person, an eager want.

## Six Ways to Make People Like You

In this section, Carnegie outlines six principles that enable individuals to become more likable. These include showing a genuine interest in others, listening attentively, and making them feel important. Listening with genuinely interest and asking relevant questions to hear more. Being a listener makes a good conversationalist. When giving your full attention, it helps to sincerely acknowledge and praise the other person's knowledge or skills. It must be sincer, else you come of as shallow. This applies to business as well.

> Let angry customers talk, and afterwards help then turn a bad experience into a good, by considering what would make them happy.

Remember, a tiny scratch on the person’s arms is often of more interest than an earthquake on the other side of the world where hundreds died.

By engaging in active and empathetic communication, readers can enhance their interpersonal skills and forge stronger bonds with others. Consider it a rule of thumb to always make the other one feel important/appreciated, and do to others as you would have others do to you. Express same attraction and appreciation at home. This is maybe the most needed and neglected place.

This section of the book outlines the following principles to sum it up.

- Principle 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.
- Principle 2: Just smile. The effect of a smile is powerful. Your smile comes through in your voice.
- Principle 3: Remember the person name, as it is of great importance to that person and they feel important if you remember them by name.
- Principle 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Talk about what she/he treasures the most.
- Principle 5: Talk about their interest and warm them up before coming to the points of your interest/what you want.
- Principle 6: Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.

## How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

Carnegie delves into the art of persuasion, influence, stressing the significance of persuasion through reason, avoiding arguments, and always seeking common ground to gain their cooperation. He highlights the importance of acknowledging others' perspectives and encouraging them to express their thoughts. By creating an environment where people feel heard and valued, readers can foster mutual understanding and collaboration. Carnegie outlines twelve principles to enhance these motives.

Winning an argument just makes the other feel inferior and nothing good comes out of that relation. Further, winning argument is often an empty win because you will never get the opponents good will. Carnegie provides a business example from a car salesman:

> White and red truck. White is best and Busters says red is best. instead of arguing, you agree. Stops buyer from keep arguing, and seller can confirm statement by saying some good about the red before starting to talk the White up as good alternative in quality and price etc.

Be humble when you’re right: “I might be wrong, but..”. Telling a person wrong does not want them to agree with you as you have insulted their pride, intelligence and self respect. If you can be right more than 50 % of the time, you can make 1 mill a day on WallStreet, so why should you tell when people are wrong?

Focus on finding agreement first, and focus on the same end goal and overlook the different approach to the mean. It is a psychological process, as it works with the mind's habits whereas saying ‘no’ creates a physical withdrawal. This principle can become a strategy as it sometimes requires some digging to find an angel where you can get the other person into a ‘yes’ flow.

People can’t be sold. You have to make them buy, so let them talk and listen to figure how to make them buy by whats on their mind. By letting them talk, you get to understand their problems and accomplishments, which you can act upon - rather than you do it and take the focus away from them.

Get other people to get the idea instead of telling them the idea they should like. In relation to business, the idea will be to make the customer talk about how the product should be to make it their own, which will make them more incline to buy. If you get to tailor the product for your needs, you make them want to buy, instead of selling your own idea/product.

Try to listen and understand them, and find their reasoning. This opens the opportunity to get key insights into their personality. Dont condem, but put yourself in their place. Carnegie outlines this (being principle 8) as one of the most important lectures. You can be sincere because you are not them but you are you. You don't have to make them feel bad by telling what you think if it was yourself in their situation.

In a situation where a person struggles to meet the deadline you might recognize their dedication, highlighting the positive impact of their work, and emphasizing the collective goal of making a difference. Present your thoughts and concepts in a compelling and captivating manner to engage others and make your ideas memorable.

Focus on making a tangible challenge that can be measured. I relates both to business, as well as in your personal life. Even when doing workout the challenge to be to raise your standards of doing 10 pushups to increase it to 15, of if your service is rated 7/10, challenge the team to go for 8/10.

- Principle 1: Only way to get the best of an argument, is to avoid it.
- Principle 2: Show respect for the other person's opinion. Never say ‘you’re wrong’.
- Principle 3: Be up front about your mistakes and admit them.
- Principle 4: Begin in a friendly way.
- Principle 5: Get the other person to say ‘yes yes’ immediately.
- Principle 6: Let the other person do the talking.
- Principle 7: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
- Principle 8: Try honestly to see things from the other persons point of view.
- Principle 9: Be sympathetic about the other person’s ideas and desires.
- Principle 10: Appeal to the noble motives.
- Principle 11: Dramatize your ideas.
- Principle 12: Throw down a Challenge.

## Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Offending or Arousing Resentment

Leadership is a critical aspect of personal and professional success. Carnegie provides insights into effective leadership by advocating for genuine appreciation, encouragement, and the art of constructive criticism. By inspiring and empowering others, you can create an environment for people to grow without giving offense or arousing resentment.

Find a quality in the person that can be respected and admired and nourish it rather than finding weaknesses. Further, this quality can become their trademark, giving them a repulation to live up to. An example could be that the given person is the helping person, so it builds up the sense of helping each other out. People enjoy having a positivie reputation around them and gives a sense of importance.

A leader's principles coincides with the former principles of the book:

- Principle 1: Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
- Principle 2: Call attention to People’s mistakes indirectly and demonstrate what you want.
- Principle 3: Talk about your own mistake before criticizing the other person.
- Principle 4: Ask questions and give suggestions instead of giving orders.
- Principle 5: Let the other person save face.
- Principle 6: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement as it builds confidence and self-esteem. Remember: Must be sincere.
- Principle 7: Give the other person s fine reputation to live up to.
- Principle 8: Use encouragement. Make the fault Seem easy to correct.
- Principle 9: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
