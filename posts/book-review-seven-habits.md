In the pursuit of personal and professional excellence, few resources have left a more indelible mark than Stephen R. Covey's monumental work, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People". This book is not merely a collection of theoretical principles; it's a comprehensive guide that equips readers with practical tools to transform their lives. Covey's profound insights illuminate a clear path to self-development, offering a blueprint to navigate challenges, foster meaningful relationships, and ultimately, achieve lasting success. Let us dive into the core principles of this book, understand how each habit contributes to a holistic journey of self-mastery and empowerment.

I rate this books as a **must read** 10/10 within personal development.

There are 3 techniques for better learning, which applies to getting those habit working as part of your life:

1. Learning
2. Teach
3. Practice

Basically learn the material, the habit or what you are interested in. Once you have learned it, start teaching in the topic as that will provide repetition for your learning. Lastly, practice what you have learned so you do not just talk the talk, but you also walk the walk. This is the fundamental way to really get whatever you are trying to learn, to be part of you, as you specialize within the area and can adapt to it, making you an expert within the field. Same techniques apply to making a desired habit a part of your way of living and to change your paradigm.

> The 7 habits represents each a change in paradigm in regard to traditional way of thinking and social patterns

## What is a habit

A habit is a regular, often subconscious, behavior that becomes automatic through repetition. It's formed by a cue, a routine action, and a reward.

Habits are shaped by a combination of knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Knowledge involves understanding why a habit matters, skills are the practical actions, and attitude relates to the mindset and emotional commitment behind the habit. These three elements collectively contribute to developing effective habits for personal growth and success. Think of habits like cultivating a harvest:

Planting Seeds: Starting a habit is like planting seeds – a beginning.
Nurturing and Patience: Habits, like crops, need nurturing and time. Consistency matters.
Long-Term Growth: Habits become ingrained behaviors, part of daily life.
Bountiful Harvest: Just as a harvest takes time, habits lead to lasting results.

In short, habits are a journey of gradual growth, offering lasting benefits that quick fixes can't match. Problem is, people often goes for the quick fixes, like the football coach who builds for short term success, wins titles and resigns. This makes the new coach look bad as he has to build a lasting foundation, which the former didn’t.

This football coach example is a classic example that can be used anywhere from emotional relationsships, economy, fitness and health lifestyle and more. This is where Steven mentions the goose with the golden eggs needs nurture to create trust and lasting changes.

## Goose with the Golden Eggs

"Goose with the Golden Eggs" is a prominent concept and this metaphor serves as a powerful reminder of the value of balance, renewal, and the long-term perspective in personal and professional effectiveness.
In the story of the goose with the golden eggs, there's a farmer who owns a goose that lays a single golden egg every day. Initially, he's delighted with this extraordinary egg and the wealth it brings. However, in his eagerness for more instant riches, he becomes impatient. He decides to cut open the goose, assuming that it must have a treasure trove of eggs inside. To his dismay, he finds nothing and loses the future golden eggs.
This story is a cautionary tale about the pursuit of quick gains at the cost of sustainable growth. The goose symbolizes our own potential for productivity and success. The golden eggs it lays represent the positive outcomes we achieve through consistent effort and effective habits.
In essence, the analogy of the goose with the golden eggs serves as a reminder that effective habits, like the goose's eggs, are sources of ongoing value. It urges individuals to appreciate the rewards of consistency and patience, rather than sacrificing the future for immediate gains. This concept aligns with Covey's overall message of nurturing habits that lead to enduring success and fulfillment.

## Emotional bank account

a metaphorical representation of the trust and emotional connection individuals have in their relationships. Just like a financial bank account, deposits build up a positive balance, while withdrawals diminish trust and rapport. Deposits can include acts of kindness, understanding, showing respect, keeping promises, and genuinely listening to others. As trust grows through empathetic communication, it paves the way for better collaboration, problem-solving, and overall personal and professional effectiveness, all of which are central themes of the book.

If you have 100.000 in deficit on your emotional bankaccount, it requires many deposits over a long period of time to restore the balance and hit a surplus. Quick fixes is not the answer. It requires integrity and consequenses behind your values and habits so they are aligned (words and actions must go together)

It is difficult and slow and requires good judgment to maintain the balance between the golden egg (what we want) and the welfare of the goose (the ability to produce). Balance is the very essence of efficiency. Balancing the short-term with the long-term (synergy):

- Habit 1: Be Proactive
- Habit 2: Begin With the End in Mind
- Habit 3: Put First Things First
- Habit 4: Think Win-Win
- Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
- Habit 6: Synergize
- Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw

The first 3 habits are character habits. The next 3 habits are personality habits. The character habits are fundamental for long term value, and the personality habits builds on top of them. Applying only the latter personality habits will develop a charcater of short term solutions where you keep withdrawing from the emotional bank account. Crawl before you can walk; the first habits nailed before focusing on the last ones.

## Habit 1: Be Proactive

Covey introduces the concept of the "Circle of Influence" and the "Circle of Concern." Highly effective individuals focus their energy on aspects they can control or influence—their Circle of Influence—instead of dwelling on concerns beyond their control. By adopting a proactive mindset, individuals take charge of their responses to circumstances, enhancing their ability to shape outcomes. This habit empowers individuals to transcend limitations and cultivate a sense of responsibility for their lives. This is the most basic and fundamental habits of them all.

An example given: A picnic is planned but the the weather turns and for the remainder of the day it is raining. Solution: Go somewhere else, or plan a picnic in the basement with games and treats.

Opposite of being proactive is to be reactive. Going back to the picnic example, a reactive person would say: "What is the use, we can't change the weather, and complain about it".
Reactive people are controlled by: Generic determinism, psychic determinism or the determinism of the outside world.

> Generic determinism: It's your grandparents' fault that you have a hot temper. You from Greece and that is how we are.
> Psychic determinism: Parents' fault. I am a B-person because of them, hence I am programmed by them.
> Determinism of the outside world: Boss or spouse's fault, or even the economy or politics - therefore you are unhappy or dissatisfied.

Reaction people are defined by one or more of these determinisms. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy, wher ethey find evidences to back it up and they will feel like victims out of control. It is YOU who chooses the reaction to what happens to you. You can change yourself and no other so start taking responsibility and control of your life by being proactive.

Habit 1 is the habit for personal vision. Awareness of the fact that you really have control.

## Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

Effective people envision their goals and aspirations before embarking on any endeavor. Covey emphasizes the importance of crafting a personal mission statement, a concise expression of one's values and objectives/purpose. This habit encourages aligning daily actions with long-term visions, fostering a sense of purpose that guides decisions and actions. It underscores the significance of setting clear intentions to navigate your life's journey with intentionality.

Habit 2 can also be called the leadership habit. The habit of personal or organizational leadership. Consider it the top line (in business terms). Problems in for example marriage is often because of habit 3 (the focus on management) rather than the leadership. The key to success with this habit is the commitment by involvement. You have to master habit 1 (be proactive) to really excel with habit 2. This mission statement that follows the leadership based on the values is critical in taking control over your life and it creates your self-esteem and self-confidence from within. A practical example of your person mission statement, values and how to write them is by doing the exercise of writing what the speakers should say to your funeral; What would you like your family and friends to say about you, and do they say that today? - Else write what they should say and now have the valueset you should strive to live after.

## Habit 3: Put First Things First

Time management takes center stage in this habit. This is the management habit or organizational management habit. Leadership focus on direction, whereas management is about the speed, coordination and logistic of moving in the right direction. Neglected health or family as examples are bad as permanent condition and the cause of it is bad leadership where you management habits takes you in the wrong direction. This is where this habit is so important and assuring you manage your way into the right direction (compared to the top line of habit 2, this is the bottom line). In other words it executes habit 2 in practice.

Highly effective individuals prioritize tasks based on importance rather than urgency, focusing on activities that contribute to their long-term goals. Covey introduces the Time Management Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four quadrants: important and urgent (Q1), important but not urgent (Q2), urgent but not important (Q3), and neither important nor urgent (Q4). By spending more time in the important but not urgent quadrant, individuals can prevent crises and lead more balanced lives. Further, this quadrant is the key to control. The Pareto effect: 80/20 rule, where 80 % of the results comes from 20 % of the activities, all belong to Q2. Prevention is Q2 and if you neglect them, Q1 rises, where problems lie. Q3 adds value to others but yourself, so by turning down Q3 and Q4 tasks, and accepting Q2 tasks, you will automataically decrease Q1.

The core of the character in habit 3 is to do what you should do, even if you do not want to (will power), and still keep your integrity in the process. These 3 habits combined creates the control, assertiveness and independence.

## Habit 4: Think Win-Win

Covey introduces a paradigm shift from a competitive mindset to a collaborative one. This habit encourages individuals to seek mutually beneficial solutions in interactions, fostering an atmosphere of trust and cooperation. By embracing abundance rather than scarcity, people can transcend the limitations of zero-sum thinking and build lasting relationships based on respect and understanding. Not all solutions will become win-win, but the central point is the relationship. The win-win solutions is also highly dependend on the emotional bank account. in times of an account in deficit, a strained trust to the counterpart often makes a solution in compromise rather than synergistically.

Only realistic outcome in business is win-win. Win-loss and you loose the customer because you are the only one really benefiting from the deal. Loss-win and you are practically giving away your business. Neither of the latter two will work long term, which makes it vital for you to get this habit right. It requries courage, confindence and thoughness in negotiations to ensure it stay within the win-win teretory. As an example, focus on a customer and supplier who both negotiate the best possible deal.

Habit 4 and 5 correlates closely to get win-win transations to happen, as the listening process is essential in understanding the counterpart thus knowing the others desires to create win-win based upon knowing what all involved wants.

## Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood

Effective communication forms the crux of this habit. Covey emphasizes the importance of empathetic listening — a skill that enables individuals to truly understand others before expressing their own viewpoints. This approach enhances relationships, minimizes misunderstandings, and opens the door to constructive dialogue. By practicing empathetic communication, individuals can bridge gaps and foster more meaningful connections.

This is crusial because people deep down wants to feel understood. This requires massie amount of energi and empathy. People have a lot of baggage, and you can't put new wine in old bottles. You need to empty them first. It takes time to fill the emotional bank account before you can get people to trust you to express yourself.
Listening empathetically means that you listen for feelings and meaning, you listen with your eyes for behaviour.

> You cannot understand another with your own autobiography. You have to understand them from their autobiography (their frame of reference).

Biggest problem with communication is that 99 % of all problems are rooted in misunderstanding at an early stage. Why? Because we don't see the world as the world is. We see the world as we are. Don't look for facts but opinions. It is opinions that give the facts meaning.

Most people think they see the world objectively and that is wrong, but it says a lot about where you stand and why you think you are right and why disagreements arise. It is psychological and often both are right within their own frames of reference, but conflict in the world view of others.

If you fulfill a person's need to be understood, you also fulfill the need to be appreciated. Then people feel valued and affirmed as human beings. Human contributions to a negotiation are often far more important than the technical contributions to the agreement.

Habit 5 is important and perhaps the most important and most effective. It is essential to creata habit 6, where you can create creative and synergistic alternatives that accommodate the interests of both parties and create a win win.

## Habit 6: Synergize

Synergy, the belief that collaborative efforts yield greater outcomes than individual endeavors, underpins this habit. Covey suggests that when people combine their unique strengths and perspectives, they can create innovative solutions and achieve results beyond their individual capabilities. Embracing diversity and valuing differing opinions become the keys to unlocking the full potential of collaborative synergy.

## Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw

Covey likens individuals to a saw that needs regular sharpening to remain effective and prevent sameness and stagnation. This habit emphasizes the importance of self-renewal across four dimensions: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. By dedicating time to activities that rejuvenate each aspect, individuals can sustain their energy, creativity, and overall well-being. This habit promotes a holistic approach to personal development and self-care.

## The circle of influence

The circle consists of 2 circles: The innermost circle is called the <em>circle of influence</em> and the outermost is called the <em>circle of concern</em>. The latter is 10 fold the former. The inner circle is of your control whereas the outer cirle is out of your control.

<image class="m-auto" src="/images/posts/img9_circle_of_influence.png" alt="The circle of influence and the cirle of concerns" />

In relation to the 7 good habits, you can ONLY start in the inner circle. Your ability to gain influence is a function of yourself (from expandind your inner circle) by working with the positive energy and become a role model for your surroundings. Conversely, if you spend time on the outer circle of concern, the inner circle will be weakened due to neglect. Outer circle creates negative energy and thereby has negative direct effects. If you think problems are caused by others or things out there, it is the thought process itself that is the problem.

Inner circle work will develop your proactive muscles and make you think about your mission and its execution (habits 1-3) - forcing you into quadrant 2 where you will use habits 4-6 if you are to be successful at it and be effective in relation to other people.

## Conclusion

With a rapid changing world and relentless challenges, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey emerges as a beacon of timeless wisdom. This book encapsulates a holistic framework for personal development, guiding readers toward a life of purpose, productivity, and meaningful relationships. By internalizing and practicing these seven habits, individuals can unlock their potential, navigate complexity with grace, and become architects of their own success. Whether you're seeking to enhance your professional prowess, enrich your personal life, or simply embark on a journey of self-discovery, Covey's principles provide the roadmap to lasting effectiveness.

Habit 1-3 builds your security on your integrity in relation to your value system. It's your character and you don't compare yourself to others. Avoid scarcity mentality fatigue like when only one person can become number 1, because you might not be, and with scarcity mentality means that you find it more difficult to rejoice in the success of others, even if they are close people you care about.

Habit 4-6 cannot be lived with scarcity mentality. Habit 4: think win-win is not a zero sum mindset. It is cooperation and team-based thinking. "We" instead of "I". The relationships habits leads to reciprocity, mutual benefits and shared victories. The whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts.

You probably already know the habits because it is not something newly invented. It is common sense, but what is common sense is not common practice. Let's learn them over and over until they become common practice. Then teach others about them, get involved socially and start living by them, and we ourselves will become beacons in other people's lives.
