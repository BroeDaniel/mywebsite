Cell-based meat, also known as lab-grown meat (or cultured meat even), promises to revolutionize the way we produce and consume meat. Unlike traditional meat, which requires raising and slaughtering animals, cell-based meat is made by growing muscle tissue from animal cells in bioreactors (cultivators). This process has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of meat production and addresses the ethical concerns associated with traditional meat.

1. One kilogram of beef requires 15 liters of water on average, while nearly 80% of the world’s agricultural land is used for beef production.<sup>1</sup>
2. Cell-based meat could cut down greenhouse gas emissions by 96% <sup>2</sup>
3. Potential to cut our water consumption between 82% and 96% <sup>3</sup>

The current challenges within traditional meat production are significant. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, livestock production accounts for approximately 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector combined. Additionally, meat production requires a large amount of land and water, and contributes to deforestation and habitat loss. In some areas, water scarcity and pollution from animal waste are also major issues. These challenges are only expected to increase as global demand for meat continues to grow.

Given these challenges, it's clear that a more sustainable and ethical approach to meat production is needed. Cell-based meat has the potential to reduce land and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and the need for antibiotics and other inputs associated with traditional meat production. In this article, we will explore the technology behind cell-based meat, its potential benefits, and the challenges that still need to be overcome, before it can become a widespread alternative to traditional meat. <br><br>

## What is cell-based meat

Cell-based meat is a genetically engineered product that uses bio-technology. The concept is not new. In 1931, Winston Churchill predicted:

> "We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium." <sup>4</sup>

It wasn't until the 2000s, however, that the first cell-based meat prototype was created by a team of Dutch scientists led by <a href="https://www.su.org/experts/mark-post" target="_blank"><em>Mark Post</em></a>. The team used muscle cells taken from a living cow and grew them into small pieces of meat in the lab. It is created by culturing animal cells in a laboratory to grow meat tissue. The process typically involves:

1. Taking a small sample of animal cells, usually from muscle tissue (without causing harm to the animal)
2. Isolate the cells: Next, the cells are separated from the rest of the tissue and placed into a nutrient-rich liquid solution.
3. Multiply the cells: The cells are then encouraged to grow and divide using various growth factors and other nutrients.  
4. Form the meat: Once the cells have multiplied enough, they can be shaped into the desired meat product using a variety of techniques. For example, the cells can be pressed into thin sheets, stacked to form muscle fibers, or combined with other ingredients to create ground meat.
5. Harvest the meat: Finally, the meat is harvested and processed using techniques similar to traditional meat production methods, such as cooking or packaging for sale.

The resulting product is biologically identical to conventional meat, but without the need for raising and slaughtering animals.

Note: This process can vary depending on the technology being used, as there a many approaches to create cell-based meat, such as Scaffold-based, Self-organizing, Bioreactor-based, Nanofiber-based, Decellularization and recellularization to name a few. 

One of the key differences from conventional meat is the nutritional content. Cell-based meat can be designed to have a specific nutritional profile, with researchers able to control the amount of fat, protein, and other nutrients in the meat. Additionally, it does not contain antibiotics or hormones, which are commonly used in conventional meat production.

> “The process of making cultivated meat is similar to brewing beer, in that this is an industrial cell culture process based upon well-hewn fermentation technology. However, instead of growing yeast or bacteria, we grow animal cells. We start by taking a small amount of cells from high-quality livestock animals, like a cow or chicken, and then figure out which of those cells have the ability to multiply and form delicious meat food products. From there, we put the cells in a clean-and-controlled environment and provide them with the essential nutrients they need to naturally replicate and mature" - Eric Schuzle, the Vice-President of product and regulation at UPSIDE Foods <sup>5</sup>

## Key benefits ##
Reduced environmental impact: Traditional meat production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water consumption. Cell-based meat has the potential to significantly reduce these environmental impacts. According to some estimates, cell-based meat could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 96%, land use by up to 99%, and water consumption by up to 96%.

Increased food security: As the global population continues to grow, there are concerns about the ability of traditional farming methods to keep pace with demand. Cell-based meat has the potential to address these concerns by providing a more sustainable and efficient way to produce protein-rich foods

Addressing ethical concerns: Many people have concerns about the welfare of animals raised for food, and the conditions in which they are kept. This new approach can provide a way to produce meat without the need to raise and slaughter animals.

## Current State and challenges ## 
The technology  has made significant progress in recent years, with numerous companies and research institutions investing in the field. Many startups are working on developing methods to grow muscle cells, with a focus on creating meat that is nutritionally equivalent to conventional meat.

One of the main challenges currently facing cell-based meat is regulatory approval. Though the challenge within the regulatory space is declining, with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely coordinating with the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), to ensure that they are safe and accurately labeled. Both agencies are working with manufacturers to ensure these products meet all applicable FDA and USDA-FSIS requirements.

In December 2020, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulatory framework for novel foods, including cell-based meat.  In the EU. Cultivated meat – if produced without genetic modification – is regulated under the EU Novel Food Regulation. The system is ready to receive applications, but potential risks are still unclear. 

Despite this challenge, several companies have already made significant progress. For example, Memphis Meats, a California-based startup, has produced cell-based beef, chicken, and duck meat, while Mosa Meat, a Dutch company, has produced a cell-based hamburger.

Since developing the first prototypes, companies have been able to reduce production costs by 99 percent, According to McKinsey. If costs follow the same trajectory cultivated meat can achieve cost parity with conventional meat by 2030.


Some other challanges are:

1. Scale-up: Producing cell-based meat on a commercial scale is still a challenge. The technology is still in its early stages, and companies are still trying to figure out how to produce it at a large scale.
2. Consumer acceptance: Cell-based meat is a relatively new concept, and consumers may be hesitant to try it. It remains to be seen whether people will be willing to buy and consume cell-based meat on a large scale.
3. Taste and texture: It needs to taste and feel like real meat to be successful. Some people who have tried cell-based meat have reported that it doesn't taste the same as traditional meat, so improving the taste and texture will be an important challenge to overcome.
4. Sustainability: cell-based meat is often touted as a more sustainable alternative to traditional meat production. However, there are still concerns about the sustainability of the process, such as the energy required to produce it and the environmental impact of the materials used in the process.

Overall, cell-based meat has a lot of potential as a sustainable alternative to traditional meat production, but there are still many challenges that need to be overcome before it can become a mainstream food source.

**Technology for more than meat** <br>
One area of interest is the development of cell-based leather, which could offer a more sustainable and ethical alternative to traditional animal leather. By using similar techniques to grow animal tissue, cell-based leather could be produced without the need for animal slaughter or extensive land use.

Another potential application is the production of eggs, which could offer similar benefits as cell-based meat in terms of sustainability and animal welfare. The process would involve growing chicken cells in a culture medium, which would then differentiate into egg cells. This could provide a more efficient and ethical method of egg production, as well as potentially addressing concerns around issues such as avian flu.

In addition to meat, leather, and eggs, cell-based meat technology could have other applications in the production of animal products. For example, it could be used to produce milk, which could have implications for the dairy industry and animal welfare more broadly. By reducing the need for animal farming, this technology could help address some of the ethical and environmental concerns associated with animal agriculture. <br><br>

## Conclusion ##

Cell-based meat has the potential to revolutionize the food industry by providing a sustainable and ethical alternative to traditional meat production. By eliminating the need for animal slaughter and reducing the environmental impact of livestock farming, cell-based meat could help mitigate the negative effects of meat consumption on the planet.

While there are still some challenges that need to be addressed, such as the high cost of production and the need for more research on the nutritional content and taste of cell-based meat, but the future looks promising for this emerging industry.

The benefits of cell-based meat are clear, and as technology advances and production costs decrease, we may see more and more consumers embracing this alternative to traditional meat. By doing so, we can reduce the environmental impact of meat production, improve animal welfare, and potentially even create a more sustainable and ethical food system. <br><br>
